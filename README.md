# RFM-and-K-Means-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis


## Overview

This project analyzes ecommerce customer data using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) analysis and K-Means clustering. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behaviors and segmenting them based on their interactions with the ecommerce platform. The goal is to derive actionable insights for marketing and customer relationship management.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Filters and preprocesses ecommerce data to ensure quality and accuracy.
- **RFM Analysis**: Computes Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each customer to assess their behavior.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Uses K-Means clustering to group customers into distinct segments.
- **Visualization**: Provides bar plots and histograms to visualize customer distribution and segmentation results.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `lifetimes` (for RFM analysis)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn lifetimes
